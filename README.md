+ **EPG - download & replace**

   - simple enigma2 plugin to download & replace '/etc/enigma2/epg.dat' file

+ **ChocholousekPicons - plugin for updating Chocholousek's picons in Enigma2**

   - The original intent for developing this plugin was to save free space on the device's internal disk. The plugin downloads a series of Internet archives (7-zip) with piconami, for user-selected satellite positions. From the archives, the plugin unpacks only the necessary picons to the internal disk (depending on the service reference codes found in the "userboquet" files).
